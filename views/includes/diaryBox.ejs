                Dear Diary,<br/><br/>
                
                Today I went to Bangalore railway station, Yeshwantpura, to receive my uncle and aunt who were coming from Mumbai. 
                It was a bright sunny day. Sun was shining like a star. While I and my father were crossing the Orion mall, 
                we saw three elephants that made me reminded of my Kerala trip.<br/><br/>
                
                Last year I went on a Kerala trip, where we visited around 5 cities like Cochin, Wayanad, Munnar, Kovalam, and Alappuzha. 
                All the places were really awesome and beautiful. Then we went to Elephant junction Thekkady, Kumily, where people go for elephant rides.
                 I rode sitting above the elephant around for 2 and half hours. Then we have also done elephant bath and feeding.
                  We took a lot of pictures with elephants. It was a nice trip and I still canâ€™t get over it.<br/><br/>
